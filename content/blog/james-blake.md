During the 2011 production of Drake’s _Take Care_, Rolling Stone reported on the state of Noah “40” Shebib’s studio in Toronto. “The vibe is industrial yet cozy: exposed brick, low lighting, plenty of high-grade weed and virtually no decoration aside from a vinyl copy of U.K. dubstep crooner James Blake's debut on a windowsill.” Released in February 2011, the icy _James Blake_ quietly disrupted the early decade with its disassembled pop sound, heard in traces on “Marvin’s Room” and “Cameras.” Drake isn’t the only one who worships Blake; in a radio interview with Philadelphia’s Wired 96.5, a post-_Yeezus_ Kanye West emphatically commended Blake, demanding listeners to “Just go listen to his music and say, ‘Hey, that’s Kanye’s favorite artist.’” Despite the critical adoration, Blake remains introverted and enigmatic and his debut LP remains the closest we may get to his reserved genius, a declaration of self via minimalist yet effective songwriting that feels like what all music futuristically strives to be. Revisiting James Blake almost seven years after its release reveals its subtle yet profound effect on music today, an effect that Drake and West forecasted and have enhanced through their emotive vocals over trip-hop loops.

Much of the work on _James Blake_ was accomplished when Blake was 21 to 22 years old. As the son of English prog-rock guitarist James Litherland, Blake has always been surrounded by music, and he acknowledges his father’s upbringing on “The Wilhelm Scream.” In this cover of his father’s twangy song “Where to Turn,” Blake plays with space as an African drum beat and Telecaster fight for attention against increasing layers of ambient terror. The sound becomes claustrophobic and his voice anxiously flutters until all instruments eventually erupt in a slow, lava-like ooze. Similar to how Jamie XX completely reworked the source material of Gil-Scott Heron on _We’re New Here_, Blake reinvents his father’s yacht-rock sound here and in a cover of Feist’s “Limit to Your Love” later on in the tracklist. James Blake was the world’s introduction to Blake’s singing voice, which can be compared to Thom Yorke or Justin Vernon for its robotic coldness. He uses his vocals as a vulnerability on “Why Don’t You Call Me” and then as a wobbling bass replacement on “I Mind.” On “Limit to Your Love,” Blake brings intensity to Feist’s lyrics as his voice trembles like the waves when he says “waterfalls” and reverses the intonation of the line “Is it truth or dare?” Gone is the lush instrumentation from the original song as Blake only utilizes a dubstep bass flutter, a snare snap, and a piano as his backing, occasionally also adding a vocoder to his voice so that his accusations of love limits actually sound mathematical. Artists since Blake have done similar bare-boned covers that practically transfer ownership of the song, like Lorde’s perfectly captured cover of The Replacements “Swingin Party,” where she explores the rich qualities of her voice over just a dusty electronic organ.

Blake’s biggest modern influences are Burial’s _Untrue_ and The xx’s _xx_, two other England-based genre beatniks. Blake’s dubstep style is most memorable on “I Never Learnt to Share,” where he repeats a lyrical mantra into madness, complete with a final minute of exploding drill bits, high-pressured synths, and surprisingly little bass. Just a few songs later is minimalist piano ballad “Give Me My Month,” Blake’s untouched voice tricking the listener into feeling grounded for a moment before floating away in pitch-shifted and sliced up vocals on “To Care (Like You).” In an interview with Billboard in 2013, he best summarizes his uncategorizable sound with a conversation between him and a NYC cab driver: “I was actually struggling in a cab yesterday, and I was saying I was gonna do a show at Terminal 5. [The driver] asked me what kind of music it was, and I said, 'It's kind of electronic.' And he went 'Oh, we just had Tiesto on the radio.' I went yeah, 'It's not really like that.' And in my head, I was thinking of Tiesto standing on his monitors, pumping his fists. But I didn't have any better description. I didn't know what to say. I knew vaguely it might sound like almost anybody.” What Drake or West revere in Blake is his ability to remain outside of classification, to sound like anybody but also so uniquely himself with as little tools as possible. Most of Blake’s singing is repetition, there’s at least one-second gaps of silence between every beat in “Limit to Your Love,” and his mechanical white male voice tries so hard to be soul- by all means, his music should be considered boring and shouldn’t work the way it does. The ‘00s maximalism in indie and electronic, best displayed in the frantic instrumentation of Vampire Weekend and Animal Collective, bred the minimalism James Blake established for the ‘10s, and the cycle continues. It’s no wonder a record like 2016’s _Blonde_ received so much acclaim for shocking the listener with softness and quiet, and further not a surprise that Blake has production credits on almost half the record.

In an interview with Pitchfork in 2015, pop’s reigning sovereignty Madonna cited James Blake as her most recent inspiration, even expressing jealousy at his talent. It’s equally baffling to remember that there’s basically a full James Blake song on Beyoncé’s 2016 _Lemonade_, one of the decade’s most popular albums by one of the decade’s most popular artists. As lazy as it is to refer to Blake as an enigma, I fail to find any other word to describe him and his creeping importance as a pop figure. Blake’s later records, _Overgrown_ and _The Colour in Everything_, struggled to gain as much traction and praise as his 2011 self-titled, but he is still respected as the musician’s musician. Eventually, pop music will find praise with heavy instrumentation and loud noises again- where will James Blake be then? When asked about his impact in an interview with The Guardian last year, Blake politely smiled and laughed: “It’s like the opposite of punk, isn’t it? I got them all to shut up. I’ve subdued a generation. That will be my legacy.”
