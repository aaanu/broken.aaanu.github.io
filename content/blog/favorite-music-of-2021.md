I will not include Playboi Carti's _Whole Lotta Red_ in this list. Assume that it would be AOTY 2020. My favorite songs from it are "Control", "Sky", "Stop Breathing", "New N3on", "Over", "King Vamp" and "F33l Lik3 Dyin". Also, obviously "American tterroristt" would be my favorite song of 2020 (by RXKNephew).

And now my favorite albums:

1. _Pray for Haiti_ by Mach-Hommy

I spent a lot of time repeating 1:50 -> 2:50 of ["Au Revoir"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eGkPZcOpf8)... "Making sure that everybody and their momma heard of Mach-Hommy"

2. _Heaux Tales_ by Jazmine Sullivan

The first time I heard ["Lost One"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NMz1jsoNoU) on my first listen of the album, I think my jaw dropped. Also, Ari and Jazmine did a great [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie-cWWGB4ww) all about sitting on the dick.

3. _Bo Jackson_ by Boldy James

"Servin Dorothy Toto, got her heels clickin'"

4. _Sour_ by Olivia Rodrigo

Memories of playing this on a girls road trip over the summer, and ["deja vu"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cii6ruuycQA) one of the best songs of the year

5. _Donda (Deluxe)_ by Kanye West

I know, I know... It's not a great album but when tasked with a project that memorializes your mother in the title, how can you honor that? It has to be imperfect and heavenly. The guest features on _Donda_ are incredible. Fivio Foreign's on "Off the Grid" is one of the best I've ever heard.

6. _Navy's Reprise_ by Navy Blue
7. _Glow on_ by Turnstile
8. _Hitler Wears Hermes 8: Sincerely Adolf_ by Westside Gunn
9. _Happier Than Ever_ by Billie Eilish
10. _Make Drunk Cool Again_ by RXKNephew

Honorable mentions: _The Crashing Soung of How It Goes_ by Cities Aviv, _Home Video_ by Lucy Dacus, _The Voice of the Heroes_ by Lil Baby and Lil Durk, _A Beginner's Mind_ by Sufjan Stevens and Angelo De Augustine
