What have I been listening to? Shordie Shordie, I can't believe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WyLkGp9eM0" target="_blank">"Bitchuary"</a> is a hit viral song. It's so odd and so mean! His tape, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lBDMQD9MEu0CaJjKhx3KCZeEViBhWJQvc" target="_blank">>Music</a>, is real good. I've been big on Kaash Paige for the past year and her new song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxzowgafYyg" target="_blank">"Frank Ocean"</a> is enchanting.

Kalan.frfr is a rapper from Los Angeles who has never made a bad song. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aPWL4UetPw" target="_blank">"Hot N Ready Freestyle"</a> from January 2019 is soooo good because his rapping is so energized and surprising, and his 2018 tape <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kalanfrfr/sets/twofr" target="_blank">Twofr</a> is addicting. It's got these exciting tracks mixed with real chill lows, like my personal favorite track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWTEMsG2K8" target="_blank">"Bluez."</a>

Rapper Ivorian Doll's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcxXIchi7XQ">"Rumours"</a> is so cocky and I can't wait for when I can start going out again and pre-game to this UK drill beauty. "Messi / that's how I shoot my shot" coming from a girl rapper made me so excited when I first heard this. Yaeji's most recent full-length mixtape, <a target="_blank" href="https://xlrecordings.com/buy/yaeji-whatwedrew">What We Drew</a>, is really excellent and I mostly love how clean it sounds. It's got fun moments like "Free Interlude" and tracks to carelessly dance to like "Money Can't Buy" and "Waking Up Down." It's really well done!

An old song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za5iZ2x9K2c" target="_blank">"Scope"</a> by WifiGawd and Black Kray has floated into my attention span again. I'm always a fan of new rappers biting old historical songs, and Rich the Kid's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5swevjLg22g" target="_blank">"Ray Charles"</a> is an example of that. Playboi Carti teased the masses about a possible new album release and of course didn't deliver, but he did release a new song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMDOSLEVdBw" target="_blank">"@ Meh"</a> that I love. It's so cool to me that he made the album art come to life in the music video.

And yeah, I'm a bandwagon fan on the new The 1975 song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYYQpTbBSBM" target="_blank">"If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)."</a> I don't know if calling myself a bandwagon fan is the right term, I've just seen a lot of mass critical acclaim for whatever The 1975 do these days. I've always had a kinda "bully" personality, making fun of the girl who did cosplay and spoke in anime voices in 7th grade and later spreading false rumors in high school. I made fun of people in college for listening to The 1975, purely because their 2016 album title <em>I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It</em> made me cringe so hard. That title still does kinda make me cringe. I got obsessed with The 1975 when I listened to 2018's <em>A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships</em> a lot in the fall of 2019. It's _such_ a good album. "TooTime" is hypnotizing, "Sincerity is Scary" floats on these lovely background horns and their modern commentary throughout all the tracks is phenomenal songwriting. I don't have to sing my praises of "Love It If We Made It," one of the best songs of the past decade, but that sealed me in as a The 1975 fan forever.

Otherwise I've still been listening to a lot of comfort music to get me through these uncertain times. Old Gucci Mane tapes, Future's _Beast Mode_, Chief Keef _The Leek_ tapes, Notorious B.I.G's "Unbelievable" (the first verse blows me away every time), DaBoii's 2018 _Neva Lookin Back_, Fmb Dz's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhvumB-6cTk" target="_blank">"High Speed"</a> ft. Rio Da Yung Og... I will also announce here, my current AOTY is Bad Bunny's _YHLQMDLG_. 

_YHLQMDLG_ is amazing. It is uplifting, horny, fun, respectful, introspective, fun, eloquent and fun. Latin trap beats do not get the respect they deserve, and they are explosive on this Bad Bunny album. He starts with "Si Veo a Tu Mama," a bare keyboard playing a playful almost nursery-like tune and Bad Bunny's voice booming, and it's _soothing_? Then his voice bounces so appropriately over the same keyboard loop ("Solo comparto memes, ya yo no escribo nada" oh my God), sometimes cooing about his ex-fling's mom. Throughout the album is more of this confident mastery. Bad Bunny bringing on Reggaeton legend Daddy Yankee on a song that audiences of all ages will love, the unrelenting horniness of "Safaera" which has eight unique movements, the epic rock song ending of "Hablamos MaÃ±ana," the infectious pop sound of "Vete".. there is no flaw on this album. And the moment that really solidified as one of my favorite albums ever is the closer, "<3", a somber note to his listeners and his family. Bad Bunny has had an incredible rise, he was waving the Puerto Rico flag at Super Bowl LIV, man. He shouts out this ridiculous rise to fame in "<3" but in such a heartbreaking way ("Abuela, bendiciÃ³n, hoy cumplÃ­ otro goal, je / Me fue cabrÃ³n, no sÃ© si me viste en el Super Bowl"). It's so down to Earth, similar to other line from the song "Si LeBron es LeBron con 23 o con el 6 / Por cierto, ayer lo vi, 'taba conmigo en el stage". Bad Bunny is _it_. Pay attention to him. He's making the best music today.

I'll take the rest of the post to shout out good articles I've read this week.

- Scott Hines's substack is great and I'd highly recommend subscribing to him. I love <a href="https://actioncookbook.substack.com/p/all-the-small-things?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5ODY4OTUsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM3MjkxNiwiXyI6InBpeXBCIiwiaWF0IjoxNTg2ODY5MjkwLCJleHAiOjE1ODY4NzI4OTAsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMjAyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.U6bu9FdWOl6O4TX0SA0VlEq38NJCDQsyDddfhJpGtfU" target="_blank">"All the Small Things"</a> and <a href="https://actioncookbook.substack.com/p/life-goes-on-in-flavortown?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5ODY4OTUsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDE4NiwiXyI6InI3dzNiIiwiaWF0IjoxNTg3Mzg1ODkzLCJleHAiOjE1ODczODk0OTMsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMjAyOCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.1KXqjpcDxzVPOSnFakiG4JvmTBvIRxZgl7r7C9kaHcE" target="_blank">"Life Goes On In Flavortown"</a>. He talks about the comfort in watching Guy Fieri's Triple D (I've actually been watching a lot of Triple G, there was a marathon of it recently) and the sudden need to think about all the small details during this quarantine. He says, "The small details matter, though â€” the details of how a store is designed, how a city is put together, how our physical and social structures move us around, how people in a society consider one anotherâ€™s existence and decide to take care of each other or not."
- Brianna Holt's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/fashion/weddings/confessions-of-a-former-serial-dater.html">"Confessions of a Serial Dater"</a> was written about me ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ Not actually, but I did read sentences in here that too often reflected the past year of my life.

>Enter the traits of serial daters: those who consciously look to have fun and donâ€™t want anything serious; who love the thrill of the chase and the power of romancing many partners; who fear commitment but also fear loneliness; who have attachment issues; who actually enjoy the glamour of the single lifestyle; who date to get narcissistic needs fulfilled; and who are confused and donâ€™t really know what they want.

- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/24-dion-waiters-nba-los-angeles-lakers">Dion Waiters on Depression.</a> As a Miami Heat fan, I always had love for Dion and always will have that love. This is a sweet piece.
- Kyle Neubeck analyzed if and how music affects how the Sixers play, which I've always wondered about myself! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/study-how-does-music-impact-sixers-76ers-offense-joel-embiid-jj-redick-tj-mcconnell/">It's a funny piece.</a>
