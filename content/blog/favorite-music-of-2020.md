I'm aware there are two months left in 2020. Figured I'd document what music I've loved the most this year. I thought it was a pretty good music year, overwhelming with releases at times. I spent a lot of time not keeping up with 2020 music and being invested in [2000-2006 rap](https://lightsleeper.substack.com/p/best-rap-2005) instead, or [Big L](https://skatenewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Big-L-Mural-Post.jpg) essentials, or [Chilean trap](https://daily.bandcamp.com/scene-report/chilean-hip-hop-list). I also got really into [Milwaukee rap](https://radiomilwaukee.org/discover-music/milwaukee-music/milwaukee-rap-roundup-chosen-one-big-wan-kmoni-j-o-eons-3xsimpson-and-more/) while the rest of the country was catching up on Detroit rap [thru TikTok](https://stayhipp.com/media/tiktok/whole-lotta-choppas-tiktok-dance-challenge/).

I'll have the albums list at the end ordered, but the following tracks will be unordered. These are my favorite songs of 2020, as well as my favorite moments in songs.

["Ohio Tpke"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhQmlWVGOjM) by Jeff Rosenstock

And now my favorite albums (subject to shift before the end of the year, of course):

1. _The Price of Tea in China_ by Boldy James
2. _Evergreen Wildchild 2_ by Lil Poppa
3. _YHLQMDLG_ by Bad Bunny
4. _Meet the Woo 2_ by Pop Smoke
5. _Eternal Atake (Deluxe)_ by Lil Uzi Vert
6. _WHAT WE DREW_ by Yaeji

8. _How I'm Feeling Now_ by Charli XCX
9. _Fuck the World_ by Brent Faiyaz
10. _Heat Check, Vol. 2_ by WiFiGawd x Tony Seltzer

If the [ShittyBoyz compilation](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF5RrorB-Yt/) of their best YouTube songs counts, that album would be in my top 5 easily.
