I like to code and listen to music. I currently live in Brooklyn, New York.

I grew up in South Florida for all 18 years of my childhood. I love to watch all sports, and my teams are

 - The Florida Marlins
 - The Miami Heat
 - The Miami Dolphins
 - The Florida State Seminoles
 - The Florida Panthers

 I did my undergrad at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts from September 2014 to December 2017. I got a minor in Cinema Studies.

 I'm a vegetarian. My favorite color is pink. I make matcha tea every morning. I can recite all of [Drake's "Headlines"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimoNqiulUE) off of memory alone. <a href="mailto:anu.gulati100@gmail.com">Reach out, let's talk: anu.gulati100@gmail.com</a>
