I'm currently a full stack Software Engineer at Reddit in New York City, NY.

## Reddit
_May 2021 - now_

I'm an engineer on the Safety Tools team at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). I work on making Reddit a safer and fairer place to be, by empowering Reddit's safety agents to process the thousands of reports made by users about content on the site.

## Etsy
_May 2018 - April 2021_

I'm a Product Engineer on the Shipping team at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). My day-to-day consisted of talking to Project Managers and Designers and building projects for mostly the buyer-side of Etsy in PHP and Javascript.

When I first started at Etsy, I revamped the shipping label purchase experience used by all Etsy sellers in less than 3 months, working heavily with Product and Design throughout the process and crafting with the in-house React & Redux architecture. I assured constant uptime of the product using Grafana logging, Behat testing, and Nagios alerting.

After my first year, I worked on experiments to increase purchase conversion rate on Etsy. This included a sitewide "simulation" where we tested how buyers would interact with free shipping on all orders over $35, showing buyers recommendations for their cart to reach a certain free shipping threshold, and updating the first page of Search results to only show listings with free shipping deals.

I also facilitated [post mortems at Etsy](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/). I assisted in promoting a blameless culture at Etsy by leading post-event sessions dedicated to decoupling extremely complex systems and walking through hindsight bias with engineers that come to work to do a great job every day. Ask me more about this, I love to talk about post mortems.

## AlphaSights
_January 2017 - September 2017_

I completed my second co-op at [AlphaSights](https://www.alphasights.com/) in New York City, New York in 2017. I implemented Google Authentication on the company's in-house recruitment application and assisted in applying this process to other internal applications, as well as sparked conversations on the security and authorization system present in the company's software architecture. I made contributions in Ruby on Rails, SCSS, and Javascript/JQuery to the company's revamp of the public website, dockerized two of the internal-facing applications for ease in versioning and continuous integration with CircleCI v2.0, and swept through and regulated unused or inconsistent code in the company's existing applications.

## True Fit
_January 2016 - July 2016_

I completed my first co-op at [True Fit](https://www.truefit.com/) in Woburn, Massachusetts in 2016. I developed a web application for managing internal system alerts using Scala, AngularJS, and SQL from the ground up, touching on all layers of the architecture (database, server, and client). I also took on the maintenance of an existing web application service and understood, refactored, and enhanced the existing software.
